    <h1>Temperament</h1>
    <p><img src="AmericanBullyForFamilies.jpg" alt="American Bully with kids">American Pitbull Terriers/American Bully descended from extremely
        people-oriented breeds. These dogs are very affectionate, even clingy. Despite their forbidding exterior,
        <em>American bully /pitbull</em> are soft-hearted, enjoy affection and interacting with humans. These dogs love
        the entire family rather than just one person and are known to adore children.</p>
    <p>American Bullies / Pit bulls have a high tolerance of pain and are able to withstand roughness and even pain
        inflicted by children. They rarely snarl and never bite. At the same time, they know that children are their

        they still need to undergo training, as these dogs’ physical strength makes them unmanageable in a hostile
        situation.</p>
    <p>American Pit-bull Terriers / American Bully have natural protective instinct but are calm. They may make
        acceptable watch dogs, but are not sufficiently aggressive for this purpose. However, they don’t really need to
        be aggressive, as their looks are often deterring enough.</p>

    <h1>The History Of Breed</h1>
    <img src="XXLPitbullPuppiesForSale.jpg" alt="Puppies for sale" width="175px">
    <p>Founded in the United States between 1980 and 1990, the American Bully was produced using a foundation
        American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers bred to several bulldog-type breeds.
        It was created with the purpose of being a family companion dog.</p>
    <p>
        American Bully’s unique feature is the fact that this breed was developed by tens or even hundreds of
        breeders rather than by a single person or club. Many of these breeders worked independently from each other.
        The states of Virginia and South Carolina were at the heart of these efforts, but the fashion spread rapidly
        across the entire country. The emergence of the breed’s name and even the exact time the breed itself came into
        existence is still a mystery. Bullies became widely known in the beginning of the XXI century but gained popularity
        in the last 5-8 years.</p>
    <p>Since the breed was created by multiple breeders who often were unsure of the end result they were trying to
        achieve, American Bully boasts a wide variety of exteriors. They may be either significantly smaller or larger
        than the original American Pit Bull Terriers. Coat markings are not regulated, either. Body type, built and
        proportions vary much more than those of other purebred dogs, with American Bully being a very stocky, muscular
        breed. Nevertheless, they closely resemble their ancestor, and are easily confused for other breeds.</p>
    <p>Like its ancestors, American Bully facilitated the formation of multiple clubs and organizations, including
        American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC), United Bully Kennel Club (UBKC), Bully Breed Kennel Club (BBKC), and United
        Canine Association (UCA). European Bully Kennel Club (EBKC) has its offices on Malta, in France, Switzerland,
        The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Italy.</p>
    <p> Despite being a young breed, American Bullies are popular in the US. The population of registered dogs is
        rather large, and the unregistered one even larger. Although there is no formal statistical data, it appears
        that there are already more dogs of this breed in the US than is required for formal breed recognition by
        kennel clubs. There are also numerous American Bullies in Europe and Russia. Today, American Bullies are
        companion dogs, but they may also be used to complete other tasks.</p>

<div class="white-article">
<h1>Feeding your puppy</h1>
    <p> Extra attention should be paid to feeding a Bully/Pit bull puppy in the first year of their life, as this is
        crucial for his skeletal system development, teeth and coat. Lack of proper nutrition may lead to rickets,
        incorrect paw size and a lackluster coat. Dogs of the same size or breed do not necessarily require the same food
        amounts. Nutrition needs depend on your pet’s activity level, their environment and metabolism particularities.</p>

    <h2>How often should you feed a puppy?</h2>

    <p> Starting at 2-3 months of age, puppies should be fed 4-5 times a day, or about every 3-4 hours; at 3-4 months of
        age, portions should be increased and meals reduced to 3-4 a day. 4-6 month-old puppies are fed 3 times a day, at
        7-9 months feedings are reduced to 2-3 times a day, and twice daily after 9-12 months of age. The food bowl should
        be removed after the meal, leaving only the water bowl. Attention: "The puppy must always have access to fresh water!"</p>
    <h2>What constitutes balanced puppy nutrition?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proteins</li>
        <li>Fat</li>
        <li>Carbohydrates</li>
        <li>Vitamins</li>
        <li>Minerals</li>
        <li>Microelements</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Protein sources: </h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Fish</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Your puppy’s diet</h2>
<p>A dog that’s being fed correctly is lively and full of energy. Don’t overfeed your dog. If your dog is lethargic and
    not interested in running during walks but isn’t showing any signs of illness it may be the result of overfeeding.
    If your dog’s skin is dry and flaky you need to add fish oil to their food.
</p>
    <p> Meat products are the most nutritious food ingredient for dogs, as they are easily digestible. However, feeding
        meat exclusively can kill a dog. Only fresh meat products may be fed raw. About 60% of B vitamins, chlorides and
        phosphates are lost during meat processing. Feeding very fatty meats, especially pork, is not recommended, as they
        may contain trichinas and tapeworms more often than other types of meat. Feeding raw saltwater fish once a week is
        beneficial for your dog, as it contains highly digestible proteins, phosphorus, vitamin A, iodine and bone matter.
        Do not feed your dog raw freshwater fish, as it has a high incidence of ascarids or whipworm infestation. Some raw
        bones (excluding tubular), scalded with boiling water, are good for your dog. They should be included in your dog’s
        diet in moderation. When fed in large quantities, they may cause indigestion or even obstruction, as well as early
        loss of teeth. Cooked bones may cause constipation.</p>
    <h2>Never Give Your Dog Tubular Bones!</h2>
    <p>Many breeders and owners feed whole chicken drumsticks to their dogs, not realizing that sharp splinters may cause
        serious damage to their intestines. It’s like playing a lottery – you can play all your life and never win, or hit the “jackpot” on the first try.
        We choose to not endanger our dogs lives, and suggest that you do the same! It’s also not recommended to include
        milk in your dog’s diet, as it may cause digestive issues, despite being rich in calcium and phosphorus.</p>
    <p> Give your dog a raw egg once a week with food. Raw eggs are beneficial for sick or recovering animals as well as
        for breeding stock animals before mating. Grinded raw vegetables are great for dogs; you should also feed some
        whole vegetables and fruit to your pet. It’s OK if some of it is not fully digested. Chewing on whole apples,
        cabbage heads or carrots helps cleanse the dogs’ teeth of the plaque. Raw vegetables, fruit, berries and meat
        should be introduced into puppies diet early and given to them regularly so that the dogs don’t get out of the
        habit of enjoying these nutritious foods.</p>

    <h2>Fruits And Berries Should Be Given In Moderation!</h2>

    <p>Hot seasonings, as well as all types of sweets and pastries, cause itching and hair loss and are contraindicated to your dog. </p>

    <h2>What temperature should dog food be served?</h2>
<p> The food temperature must not exceed 30 degrees Celsius. Never give hot or frozen foods to your pet.</p>

    <h2>Basic feeding guidelines</h2>
   <div class="width-list">
	<ol>
        <li>Feed your dog at the same time every day. Any food not eaten within 20 minutes should be taken away.</li>
        <li>If you feed your dog a natural diet, it should be:
        <ol type="a"><li>room temperature, never hot or cold;</li>
            <li>fresh;</li>
            <li>thick (watery foods are inconsistent with dogs’ digestive systems).</li>
        </ol>
        </li>

        <li>If you feed your dog dry food, follow the directions on the packaging.</li>
        <li>Dogs must always have access to a bowl of clean water regardless of whether they are fed dry or “natural” food.</li>
	   </ol></div>
    <p> It is recommended that dogs of tall breeds be fed from a bowl elevated to their chest level, to stimulate proper
        skeletal development. Bowls with moveable supports are great for this purpose, since they can be shifted up as the puppy grows.</p>

    <h2>Raw Diet for American Bully</h2>
    <p>Dogs are carnivores. As such, they should be eating a diet of predominantly meat.  Equally as important, it should be raw. Animals don’t cook their foods. Your dog needs raw muscle meat, organs, fatty tissue, and bones.
        Raw dog food diets are controversial. But the popularity of the diets which emphasize raw meat, bones, fruits, and vegetables is rising.</p>

    <h2>Potential benefits of the raw dog food diet includes:</h2>
    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li>Shinier coats</li>
        <li>Healthier skin</li>
        <li>Cleaner teeth</li>
        <li>Higher energy levels</li>
        <li>Smaller stools</li>
        <li>Odorless  breath and body</li>
        <li>Flake-free and itch-free skin</li>
        <li>Decreased  visits to the vet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Raw dog food diet: "What it is?"</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="videos/XL Bullies.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></p>
    <p> A raw dog food diet typically consists of:</p>
    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li>Muscle meat, often still on the bone</li>
        <li>Bones, either whole or ground</li>
        <li>Organ meats such as livers and kidneys</li>
        <li>Raw eggs</li>
        <li>Vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and celery</li>
        <li>Some dairy, such as yogurt</li>
        <li>Apples or other fruit</li>
    </ul>
<p>The main benefit of raw feeding is by far a healthier and happier dog.  When dogs eat food that is biologically
    appropriate, they will absorb all the nutrients from their food making their immune system, digestive system, and
    other bodily functions stronger. This will pay off over time as your dog will need less veterinary care and will avoid
    contracting more serious diseases as they age. The amount of salt in dry food begins at 1.2%, the same percentage of
    salt that is in salted peanuts (and 4 times a dog’s RDA of salt per meal!). If there was no salt in the dry foods,
    the dogs would not touch the stuff. Due to the high amounts of salt in their diets, dry fed dogs drink huge
    amounts of water, causing higher amounts of urine. Toilet issues aside this fuels kidney disease in dogs. Although
	there are many that disagree on raw dog food diet contact your Vet for further education.</p></div>

<div class="img-black">
    <h1>Diarrhea</h1>
    <p> Diarrhea affects not only humans but also various animal species. Puppies can get diarrhea often. If your dog
        defecates 2-4 times a day and the feces have a firm texture, this is normal. More frequent and runny/watery stools
        should be a cause for concern. Many owners don’t know what to do in these situations, or simply ignore them. Such
        negligence may cost your pet their life. Panicking and hoping for the issue to resolve itself are both erroneous
        approaches when you notice diarrhea. It’s important to evaluate the severity of the dog’s condition and take
        immediate steps towards recovery.</p>
    <h2> Diarrhea in dogs may be caused by:</h2>
    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li>Incorrect feeding or poisoning with bad-quality food, chemicals, toxic substances or medicine. Often, loose
            stools may appear after feeding the dog the wrong kind of vitamins. In this case, diarrhea may disappear
            after changing the vitamins, with veterinarian’s approval;</li>
        <li>A sudden change in diet; this can often happen when transitioning from dry to wet food or vice versa;</li>
        <li>An acute viral infection, i.e. hepatitis, enteritis, distemper or other dangerous disease;</li>
        <li>Internal organ (gallbladder, pancreas, liver) infection, contracting an infectious disease;</li>
        <li> Extensive diarrhea may appear if parasites such as tapeworms are present;</li>
        <li>Stomach flora imbalance or vitamin deficiency may manifest themselves through frequent runny stools;</li>
        <li> Indigestion, or, in other words, malfunctioning of the digestive system;</li>
        <li>Allergic reactions; </li>
        <li>Malignant (cancerous) tumors;</li>
        <li>Mechanical damage to the stomach walls due to the presence of a foreign object. Swallowing of various objects causes digestive system imbalance;</li>
        <li>Sometimes diarrhea is caused by antibiotics, as they damage the intestinal flora. Loose stools may be caused
            by treating the dog with medications and vitamins intended for humans, due to the impossibility to calculate the correct dosage.</li></ul>
    <p>If your dog starts having diarrhea for any of the above reasons, immediate measures must be taken. Prolonged diarrhea may lead to dehydration and even the animal’s death.</p>


    <h2> Diarrhea and vomiting</h2>

    <p>Bloody diarrhea is a common reason for visits to the vet. That is the right decision, as the dog requires
        immediate testing for infections. Bloody diarrhea is a symptom of a serious illness, including:</p>

    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li> Salmonella;</li>
        <li>Bone splinters puncturing the dog’s anus after being ingested;</li>
        <li>Hemorrhagic leptospirosis, which causes bloody stool, may lead to death. Contact a veterinarian immediately upon noticing any symptoms;</li>
        <li>Atypical rabies or sacrosporidiosis;</li>
        <li> Chemical poisoning, infection, or side effects of medications;</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Treatment at home is ineffective; contact a veterinarian immediately. Every hour is critical and time lost may lead to the dog’s death.</p>

    <h2>Colored discharge</h2>
        <p> Dogs may occasionally develop yellow or slimy black stool. These symptoms may mean:</p>
        <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
            <li>  Yellow-colored diarrhea alerts you to your dog having contracted parvovirus enteritis;</li>
            <li>Same diagnosis is established in case of gray-colored stool;</li>
            <li>Black stool should be cause for immediate examination and testing by a veterinarian, as that’s an indication of an intestinal bleeding;</li>
            <li>Distemper manifests itself through dark runny green stool;</li>
            <li>Runny white stool is an indication of liver development issue;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of slimy stools </h2>
    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li> Parvovirus enteritis;</li>
        <li>Indigestion;</li>
        <li>A substance causing rotting in the intestines;</li>
        <li>Infection/inflammation;</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>The course of action for treating of diarrhea is determined by how dangerous and how lengthy the diarrhea is.
        Short-term, mild diarrhea may be treated by the owner at home. Sever cases of diarrhea must be treated by eliminating their cause.</p>
    <p>You must never:</p>
    <ul  style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 50px">
        <li> Attempt to treat acute, bloody or slimy diarrhea at home;</li>
        <li>Force feed an animal that is refusing to eat;</li>
    </ul>
<p> It is important to halt food intake in dogs with runny stools. Skip several meals or withhold food for 24 hours.
    However, the dog must have unlimited access to fresh water, to prevent dehydration. The next morning, offer the dog
    some chicken broth. You may also make thin rice gruel with minced chicken breast for your dog. Do not force the dog
    to finish the entire portion; a couple of tablespoons will be enough to start the recovery process. It is not recommended
    to introduce heavy, fatty foods immediately after the dog has recovered. It is best to keep feeding gruel to your pet
    for a while. If the appetite loss continues for an extended period of time, it may signify an ongoing discomfort.
    Take your dog to the vet and discuss further plans for his nutrition.

    <h1>Parvo</h1>
    <p> Canine parvovirus is an infectious viral disease that affects dogs. The virus can manifest itself in two forms.
        Digestive form is the most common, with vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss and anorexia being its main symptoms.
        The cardiac form is less common; it affects the heart muscle of puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months of age.
        This disease is occurring with a significantly lower frequency at this time due to timely vaccination of puppies.
    </p>
    <h2>Types and symptoms</h2>
    <p> The main symptoms of parvovirus enteritis are severe bloody diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, fever, vomiting and
        significant weight loss. The intestinal form of parvovirus prevents the dog’s body from absorbing nutrients,
        causing rapid dehydration and weakness due to insufficient protein and liquid intake. The mucous membranes of
        eyes and mouth become inflamed, and the heartbeat increases. The dog may experience pain or discomfort during
        abdominal palpation. Some dogs may experience lowered body temperature instead of a fever. Please see your
        veterinarian if your dogs has any of these symptoms.</p>
    <h2> Causes</h2>
    <p>The most common cause of the disease is a mutated strain of the common parvovirus – type II canine parvovirus.
        Multiple risk factors can increase the dog’s susceptibility to the infection, but the virus is usually passed
        through direct contact with an infected animal or their feces. A high concentration of the virus is contained
        in an infected dog’s excrements, and the disease is passed on to other animals through sniffing.
    </p>
<p>An owner can carry the virus into the house with fragments of infected feces on his shoes. The virus has been proven
    to be able to survive in soil for years. It is resistant to weather changes and most cleaners. If you have been in
    contact with feces for any reason, treat all affected surfaces with a cleaner containing chlorine. Only chlorine is
    known to kill parvo. Incorrect vaccination protocols or refusing to vaccinate are among the other common causes of
    parvo infection. Adhering to the correct vaccination schedule is the most effective preventive measure against parvovirus. </p>
    <p>Puppies should be vaccinated at 4, 8 and 16 weeks and then at 9 and 12 months of age. Limit your dog’s contact with other animals for 2 weeks after the last booster shot.
        All XL Bully Home puppies receive 2-3 rounds of vaccinations and are dewormed before being shipped to their new families!
