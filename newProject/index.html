<div class="temperament">

    <h1>Temperament</h1>
    <p><img src="AmericanBullyForFamilies.jpg" alt="American Bully playing with kids">American Pitbull Terriers/American Bully descended from extremely
        people-oriented breeds. These dogs are very affectionate, even clingy. Despite their forbidding exterior,
        <em>American bully /pitbull</em> are soft-hearted, enjoy affection and interacting with humans. These dogs love
        the entire family rather than just one person and are known to adore children.</p>
    <p>American Bullies / Pit bulls have a high tolerance of pain and are able to withstand roughness and even pain
        inflicted by children. They rarely snarl and never bite. At the same time, they know that children are their
        tireless playmates and best friends. As is the case with other breeds, correct socialization is key for normal
        interaction between these dogs and children.</p>
    <p>Bullies and Pitbulls strangers well, as aggressiveness was a highly undesirable trait for their ancestors. If
        raised correctly, they are friendly and well-mannered. Some individual dogs may be wary and distrustful, but
        friendly animals who regard strangers as potential friends constitute the vast majority of the breed. However,
        they still need to undergo training, as these dogs’ physical strength makes them unmanageable in a hostile
        situation.</p>
    <p>American Pit-bull Terriers / American Bully have natural protective instinct but are calm. They may make
        acceptable watch dogs, but are not sufficiently aggressive for this purpose. However, they don’t really need to
        be aggressive, as their looks are often deterring enough.</p>

        <h1>XXL/XL American bully puppies produced by XL Bully Home  Inc</h1>
        <img src="SwagKennelPuppies.jpg" alt="Merle color American Bully">
        <p>Most of our customers decide on getting an American Bully based on different factors. For some, the highly
            muscular bullies that we breed is enough for them to decide to buy while others are enticed by the gameness
            and the level of friendliness and companionship they were bred to offer. Even though American Bullies are
            descendants of pit bulls and terriers that were used during the cruel dogfighting era, their aggressiveness
            has been diluted and reduced over time through selective breeding. The bullies that we sell were bred right
            here at XL Bully Home to attain the most friendly dog. At XL Bully Home , we have been working extra hard to
            ensure only the bullies with the best traits are used for breeding. You can rest assured that any American
            Bully you buy from XL Bully Home will exceed your expectations. </p>
        <p>Some of our customers chose to buy American Bullies bred at XL Bully Home based on our reputation and experience
            in breeding high-quality companion bullies. We selectively breed all bullies by pairing well-behaved dogs to
            ensure you acquire a bully that is much easier to raise. Even though all breeds require some effort to raise,
            hair-grooming an American Bully is less intensive compared to some of the other breeds since its hair is shorter.
            Our American Bullies are intelligent, quick learners, and people-pleasers, making them much easier to train.
            Also, they are energetic and require regular exercise since they come from a long line of working dogs and have
            retained an abundance of energy from their ancestors. If you love jogging with your dog, buying an energetic
            American bully from XL Bully Home  is the right decision.</p>
        <p> For companionship, XXL Bully Home ’ American Bullies were selectively bred to increase the level of compassion
            and friendliness. Although the XL and XXL are big American Bullies, most families who visit XL Bully Home  are
            surprised by how much their children love to play and run around with them. There have been situations where
            different members of the same family became strongly attached to different bullies forcing them to go home
            with both even though they had planned to buy only one.</p>
